# Backup Management Strategy
## Norse Mythology Themed Data Protection Plan

### Overview
This comprehensive backup strategy ensures the protection of all digital assets across the nine realms, implementing the wisdom of the Norse gods to safeguard against Ragnarök-level data disasters.

## Backup Philosophy
*"As Odin sacrificed his eye for wisdom, we sacrifice storage space for security."*

### The Three Wells of Backup
Following the Norse tradition of three sacred wells, our backup strategy employs a three-tier approach:

1. **Mimir's Well (Primary Backup)** - Daily incremental backups for wisdom preservation
2. **Urðr's Well (Secondary Backup)** - Weekly full backups for fate protection  
3. **Hvergelmir's Well (Archive Backup)** - Monthly cold storage for eternal preservation

## Backup Schedules

### Daily Backups - Mimir's Wisdom
**Schedule:** Every day at 3:00 AM (during the hour of deep thought)
**Method:** Incremental backup using rsync
**Targets:**
- Active project files
- Configuration files
- Recent documents
- Database changes
- Email archives

```bash
# Daily backup script - The Wisdom Keeper
#!/bin/bash
rsync -avz --delete /home/odin/projects/ /backup/daily/projects/
rsync -avz --delete /etc/ /backup/daily/configs/
mysqldump --all-databases > /backup/daily/databases/all_dbs_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```

### Weekly Backups - Urðr's Fate
**Schedule:** Every Sunday at 2:00 AM (the day of sun and renewal)
**Method:** Full system backup using tar and compression
**Targets:**
- Complete home directories
- System configurations
- Application data
- Virtual machine snapshots
- Creative project archives

```bash
# Weekly backup script - The Fate Weaver
#!/bin/bash
tar -czf /backup/weekly/system_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz \
    --exclude=/proc --exclude=/sys --exclude=/tmp \
    --exclude=/backup /
```

### Monthly Backups - Hvergelmir's Eternity
**Schedule:** First day of each month at 1:00 AM
**Method:** Cold storage archive to external drives and cloud
**Targets:**
- Complete system images
- Historical project versions
- Media libraries
- Documentation archives
- Legacy system backups

## Storage Locations

### Primary Storage - Asgard Vault
- **Location:** Local NAS (Heimdall Guardian Server)
- **Capacity:** 54TB usable (RAID 5)
- **Purpose:** Fast access backups and daily operations
- **Retention:** 30 days rolling

### Secondary Storage - Midgard Cache
- **Location:** External USB 3.2 drives
- **Capacity:** 2x 8TB drives (mirrored)
- **Purpose:** Weekly full backups and disaster recovery
- **Retention:** 12 weeks rolling

### Archive Storage - Valhalla Eternal
- **Location:** Cloud storage (AWS Glacier/Google Cloud Archive)
- **Capacity:** Unlimited (cost-managed)
- **Purpose:** Long-term archival and off-site protection
- **Retention:** 7 years for critical data

## Backup Verification

### The Nine Realms Test
Monthly verification process testing restore capabilities:

1. **Asgard Test:** Restore critical system files
2. **Midgard Test:** Restore user documents and projects
3. **Alfheim Test:** Restore development environments
4. **Vanaheim Test:** Restore creative assets and media
5. **Jotunheim Test:** Restore large datasets
6. **Muspelheim Test:** Restore under stress conditions
7. **Niflheim Test:** Restore from cold storage
8. **Helheim Test:** Restore corrupted/damaged files
9. **Svartalfheim Test:** Restore hidden/encrypted data

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Test restore verification - The Nine Trials
#!/bin/bash
echo "Beginning the Nine Realms restoration test..."

# Test 1: System files
rsync -avz --dry-run /backup/daily/configs/ /tmp/restore_test/

# Test 2: Database integrity
mysql < /backup/daily/databases/all_dbs_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql --dry-run

# Test 3: File integrity check
find /backup -name "*.tar.gz" -exec gzip -t {} \;
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Heimdall's Watchful Eye
Automated monitoring system that alerts on:
- Backup failures or errors
- Storage space running low
- Verification test failures
- Unusually large backup sizes
- Missing scheduled backups

### Alert Configurations
```bash
# Monitoring script - Heimdall's Vision
#!/bin/bash
BACKUP_LOG="/var/log/backup.log"
ALERT_EMAIL="admin@asgard.world"

# Check if last backup was successful
if ! tail -n 1 $BACKUP_LOG | grep -q "SUCCESS"; then
    echo "Backup failure detected!" | mail -s "BACKUP ALERT" $ALERT_EMAIL
fi

# Check storage space
USED=$(df /backup | tail -1 | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/%//')
if [ $USED -gt 85 ]; then
    echo "Backup storage ${USED}% full!" | mail -s "STORAGE ALERT" $ALERT_EMAIL
fi
```

## Recovery Procedures

### Ragnarök Recovery Plan
In case of total system destruction:

1. **Immediate Response (Hour 0-1)**
   - Assess damage scope
   - Activate emergency hardware
   - Establish network connectivity

2. **Critical System Recovery (Hour 1-4)**
   - Restore operating system from images
   - Recover essential configurations
   - Restore user accounts and permissions

3. **Data Recovery (Hour 4-24)**
   - Restore databases from latest backups
   - Recover project files and documents
   - Restore application data

4. **Full Restoration (Day 1-3)**
   - Restore complete user environments
   - Recover media and archive data
   - Verify all systems operational

### Emergency Contacts
- **Odin (System Administrator):** odin@asgard.world
- **Thor (Hardware Specialist):** thor@asgard.world
- **Heimdall (Network Guardian):** heimdall@asgard.world
- **Frigg (Data Manager):** frigg@asgard.world

## Security Measures

### Encryption - Loki's Secrets
All backups are encrypted using AES-256 encryption:
```bash
# Encrypt backup files
gpg --cipher-algo AES256 --compress-algo 1 --symmetric backup_file.tar.gz
```

### Access Control - Valhalla's Gates
- Backup access restricted to system administrators
- Multi-factor authentication required
- Access logs maintained and reviewed monthly
- Regular access permission audits

## Compliance and Documentation

### Record Keeping - The Skaldic Tradition
- Backup logs maintained for 1 year
- Recovery test results documented
- Change management tracked
- Annual backup strategy review

### Compliance Requirements
- Data retention policies followed
- Privacy regulations compliance
- Industry standard adherence
- Regular audit preparation

## Budget and Cost Management

### Monthly Costs
- Local storage hardware: $50/month (amortized)
- Cloud storage: $25/month
- Backup software licenses: $15/month
- Monitoring tools: $10/month
- **Total Monthly Cost:** $100

### Annual Review
- Storage capacity planning
- Technology refresh cycles
- Cost optimization opportunities
